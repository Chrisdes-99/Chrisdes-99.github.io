          A project created by my partner and I that allows new users to create
          an account that allows them to send friend requests, view other user
          profiles, and send messages as well as additional functionality
          similiar to social media apps. Passwords, usernames, requests, and
          messages were entered into a backend database. My contributions
          include the functionality of reading/deleting messages, accept/reject
          friend requests, send messages, view profiles, creating indexes for
          sent messages, and a trigger that creates the index for each message.
